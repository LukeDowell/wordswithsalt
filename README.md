Words with Salt
=

This application has two requirements:
1. Serve as a REST api for a collection of salty sailing words
2. Scrape, persist and push weather condition data to subscribers


### Salty Word Rest API

This feature will serve as the backend to a mobile app that displays a salty word of the day. 

### Weather Data Scraping

This feature is intended to send sailors a text message with the current weather conditions on (for now) Lake Michigan.
A web interface will be provided where clients can set up their alert schedule.

### Getting Started
